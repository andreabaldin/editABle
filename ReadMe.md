# editABle.js #

`editABle.js` a versatile html table editor.  It's available as a [NuGet Package](https://github.com/andreabaldin/editABle).

It enables cells editing dynamically injecting html5 `input` or `select` elements on enabled table/rows/cells.

Two overridable behaviours:
* the html5 decoration way
* the javascript way




a DEMO website will be available.  Currently you can download, unzip the folder and open the index.html file on FireFox.  
`editABle.js` works locally, no server side required (at the moment).


## Featues ##
`editABle.js` main features are:
* cell editing through standard html5 `input` and `dropdown`, input restrictions (e.g. `max`, `step`, `pattern` ...) work;
* input supported type are: text, checkbox, numeric, password, email, number, ...;
* support cell and row template, so cells `text` and `value` can differ. A furter `boolValue` is available too
